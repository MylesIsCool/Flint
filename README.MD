# Flint [![](http://ci.caseif.net/job/Flint/branch/develop/badge/icon)](http://ci.caseif.net/job/Flint/)

Flint is a cross-platform engine designed to act as a universal backend for Minecraft minigame mods, handling generic
tasks such as arena, round, and player management which would normally require a significant time investment to develop
for each minigame.

### Usage

A tutorial is available in the [Github wiki](https://github.com/caseif/Flint/wiki/Tutorial). Additionally, documentation
is published continuously to [http://jd.caseif.net/flint](http://jd.caseif.net/flint).

### Prerequisites

Flint requires Java 7 for both compilation and use.

### Building

Flint uses Gradle as its build system. To clone and build the project from scratch:

- `git clone https://github.com/caseif/Flint.git`
- `cd Flint`
- `cp scripts/* .git/hooks`
- `./gradlew` (`gradlew` or `sh ./gradlew` on Windows)
